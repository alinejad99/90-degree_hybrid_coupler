Designing a 90-Degree Hybrid Coupler
In this project, you are tasked with designing a 90-degree hybrid coupler as shown in Figure 1.1. The goal is to design it for a specific frequency, f_0, which is 2 GHz in this case, based on the provided table and guidelines. The substrate material is 4003 Rogers with the following properties: height (h) = 20 mils, relative permittivity (εr) = 3.55, and loss tangent (tanδ) = 0.0027. The thickness of the metal layer is 18 micrometers.

Simulation Steps:
Design the 90-degree hybrid coupler according to the provided specifications using simulation software such as ADS (Advanced Design System).

Create the schematic of the designed structure.

Perform frequency domain analysis with a frequency range of 2 GHz ± 1 GHz (from 1 GHz to 3 GHz).

Tune the design frequency using the tuning tool if the desired frequency (2 GHz) is not achieved.

Tasks and Reporting:
a) Report the schematic of the designed 90-degree hybrid coupler.

b) Plot the magnitude of S-parameters (S11, S21, S31, S41) on a single graph for frequencies from 1 GHz to 3 GHz.

c) Plot the phase of S-parameters (S11, S21, S31, S41) on a single graph for frequencies from 1 GHz to 3 GHz.

d) Plot the magnitude of S-parameters (S12, S22, S32, S42) on a single graph for frequencies from 1 GHz to 3 GHz.

e) Plot the phase of S-parameters (S12, S22, S32, S42) on a single graph for frequencies from 1 GHz to 3 GHz.

f) Report the magnitude of the electric field on the ground plane of the structure.

Please make sure to follow the provided instructions carefully, perform the simulation, and report the results for each task.
