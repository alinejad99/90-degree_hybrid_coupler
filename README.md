# 90-degree_hybrid_coupler

To design a 90-degree hybrid coupler, follow these steps:

Simulation Setup:
Choose the substrate material: Use 4003 Rogers with a thickness of 20 mil, a dielectric constant (εr) of 3.55, and a loss tangent (tanδ) of 0.0027.
Set the conductor thickness to 18 µm.
Define the working frequency according to the table provided (Table 1) around 0f GHz.
Specify the line impedance as 50 ohms.
Design Steps:
Create the schematic of the 90-degree hybrid coupler as shown in Figure 1.1, and set the working frequency according to Table 1.
If the designed frequency does not match the specified value, use the tuning tool to adjust the working frequency.
Reporting:
a) Provide a report containing the schematic of the designed structure.
b) Plot the magnitude of S-parameters Sii for i = 4, ..., 1 on a single graph.
c) Plot the magnitude of S-parameters S21 and S31 on the same graph.
d) Plot the phase of S-parameters S21 and S31 on the same graph.
e) Plot the magnitude of S-parameter S41.

Simulation Optimization:
Using the schematic, create the layout of the structure in HFSS software and optimize it to achieve the desired parameters.

f) Report the layout of the optimized structure.
g) Report the plots from (b) to (e) for the optimized structure.
h) Display the electric field magnitude on the ground plane of the structure.

Please perform the simulation and design steps as described above and report your findings.
